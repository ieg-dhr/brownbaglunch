####                                              **The students' perspective**

Anna Aschauer  

Students: HS Mainz;  B. Sc.; 

Subjects: Maths, Programming, Database, Networks..

 

##### worked well:

\-     Having clear schedule for synchronous and asynchronous teaching in advance 

\-     Short online sessions every week for questions, discussing difficulties

\-     No online sessions for “lectures”: just scripts, texts, writing/calculating assignments 

\-     Routines! (particular day of the week, particular time)

\-     Clear deadline for handing-in the assignments (there is a time restriction function in “open olat”)

\-     Podcast as a format (recorded in advance, uploaded in “panopto” : http://video.hs-mainz.de/ )

\-     Organising ourselves in groups (via WhatsApp, etc..)

 

##### Was challenging for students if the lecturer: 

\-     uploaded all teaching materials at once 

\-     Changed between synchronous and asynchronous styles spontaneously

\-     Did not communicate clearly what supposed to be done until next (online) session

\-     ! Conducted lectures “as usual” live regularly and provided the slides only afterwards
