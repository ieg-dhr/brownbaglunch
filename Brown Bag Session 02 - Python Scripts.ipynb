Learning programming languages can be very time consuming and is partly comparable to learning human languages (albeit with other dimensions). However, **even without being an expert, one can learn to find, understand, and use scripts.** Important in this respect is that you have some background knowledge of a programming language so that you can understand what a script does (which also enables one, with a bit of effort, to modify a script). Acquiring knowledge of a programming language can be done though (online) tutorials and courses. For the programming language called **Python**, see e.g.\n",
